This program uses the 3 months' worth of csv files and creates a
linked list out of all of the songs, ignoring duplicates.
It then runs the list through a bubble sort to alphabetically sort them
After the list is sorted, a console menu appears, giving you the choice to display the songs
in the list in order, display the song displayed last, view the entire queue, or view the list of recently played songs. 
This program simulated a stack and queue using different functions in the linked list class.
